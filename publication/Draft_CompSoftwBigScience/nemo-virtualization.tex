\begin{abstract}
The \NEMO High Performance Computing Cluster at the University of
Frei\-burg has been made available to
researchers of the \ATLAS and \CMS experiments.
Users access the cluster from external machines connected to the
World-wide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).
 This paper describes how the full software environment of the WLCG
 is provided in a virtual machine image. The interplay between the
 schedulers for \NEMO and for the external
 clusters is coordinated through the \Roced service.
A cloud computing infrastructure is deployed at \NEMO to orchestrate the
simultaneous usage by bare metal and virtualized jobs.
Through the setup, resources are provided to users in a transparent,
automatized, and
on-demand way. The performance of the virtualized environment has been
evaluated for particle physics applications.

The VREs for ATLAS and CMS software environments consist in \Openstack containers
in the format of compatible VM images.
These images are provided in an automatized
way allowing versioning and archiving of the environments captured in
the images.
% The approaches used in the
% different groups are described in the following.

\section{Interfacing batch systems and virtual resources using \Roced}
\label{section:roced}
While HPC systems with support for virtualized research environments and commercial cloud providers offer the
necessities to acquire computing and storage capacity by dynamic
resource booking, the computing needs of high energy physics
re\-search groups ad\-di\-tion\-al\-ly require work\-flow
ma\-na\-ge\-ment sys\-tems capable of maintaining thousands of batch
jobs. Some cloud providers, for example Amazon with AWS
Batch~\cite{awsbatch}, provide a service for workflow management,
however these offerings are often limited to one specific cloud instance. To dynamically distribute batch jobs to multiple sites and manage machine life-time on specific sites, a combination of a highly-scalabe batch system and a virtual machine scheduler is desirable.

\subsection{\Roced}
\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/roced_design_flat.pdf}
  \caption{Overview of the \Roced modular design. The  \Roced Core contains the Broker which decides when and on which sites new virtual machines are booted. The Requirement Adapters report about the utilization and resource requirements of the attached batch systems. The Site Adapter is responsible to manage the lifetime of virtual machines on an cloud site and the Integration Adapter ensure that newly booted machines are integrated into the batch system.}
  \label{fig-roced}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

%$\to$ CMS Karlsruhe
Many capable batch systems exist today and they can be interfaced to virtualization providers using the cloud meta-scheduler \Roced (Responsive On-demand Cloud Enabled Deployment) which has been developed at the KIT since 2010~\cite{ROCED}. \Roced is written in a modular
fashion in python and the interfaces to batch systems and cloud sites
are implemented as so-called \textit{Adapters}. This makes \Roced
independent of specific user groups or workflows. It provides a
scheduling core which collects the current requirement of computing
resources and decides if virtual machines need to be started or can be
stopped. One or more Requirement Adapters report the current queue
status of batch systems to the central scheduling core. Currently,
Requirement Adapters are implemented for the Slurm, Torque/Moab, HTCondor
and GridEngine batch systems. The Site Adapters allow \Roced to start,
stop, and monitor virtual machines on multiple cloud
sites. Implementations exist for Amazon EC2, OpenStack, OpenNebula and
Moab-based virtualization at HPC centers. Special care has been put
into the resilience of \Roced: it can automatically terminate
non-responsive machines and restart virtual machines in case some
machines have dropped out. This allows VM setups orchestrated by \Roced with thousands of virtual machines and many tens of thousands of jobs to run in production environments.
The modular design of \Roced is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-roced}.

\section{Analysis of performance and usage}

The ROCED-based solution described above has been implemented and put into production by the research groups at the University of Freiburg (Institute of Physics) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Institute of Experimental
Particle Physics). To prove the usefulness of this approach
statistical analyses of the performance of the virtualized setup both
in terms of CPU benchmarks and usage statistics have been conducted.

\subsection{Usage statistics}
Fig. \ref{fig-frplots} shows the utilization of virtual machines which were orchestrated by \Roced depending on the resource demands of the users of the KIT group.
At peak times, up to 9000 virtual cores were filled with user jobs, consuming more than a half of the initial 16000 \NEMO cores.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/NEMO_KIT_utiliztion.pdf}
  \caption{Utilization of the shared HPC system by booted virtual machines. Up to 9000 virtual cores were in use at peak times. The fluctuations in the utilization reflects the patterns of the submission of jobs by the CMS users at the physics institute in Karlsruhe. The number of draining slots displays the amount of job slots still processing jobs while the rest of the node's slot are already empty.}
  \label{fig-frplots}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The usage of the hybrid cluster model is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig-nodeusage}.
The diagram shows the shared usage of \NEMO's cluster nodes running either
bare-metal or virtualized jobs. The part of the cluster which runs virtualized
jobs or VREs changes dynamically from job to job, since the VREs are started by
a standard bare-metal job.

At the beginning the cluster was only containing the operating system and some
basic development tools. Scientific software was added after the cluster was
already in production mode. Since the VRE for the CMS project was already
available when the \NEMO cluster started, it could already use the whole cluster
while other groups still had to migrate from other ressources. This explains the high usage by VREs in the first months of
operation. With more and more software being available for bare-metal usage the
amount of VRE jobs decreased.
% This figure is only an estimate because VRE
% projects are not forced to use VREs and therefore could run bare-metal jobs as
% well.

% The shared usage of the \NEMO cluster between jobs running in virtual
% machines and within the cluster operating system is illustrated in
% Figure~\ref{fig-nodeusage}. It shows the relative contributions of CPU hours used by jobs running
% direcly in the hosts' operating system or in virtual machines per month.
% (Ist das wirklich so angegeben?)
% The figure shows that the shares of bare-metal and virtualized jobs is
% completely flexible and can be adapted to the current needs and
% priorities of the user community.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/NodeUsage_2016-09_2018-09.pdf}
  \caption{Estimated usage of the \NEMO cluster in the time from September 2016
    to September 2018. The orange bars indicate the usage by jobs
    running directly in the hosts' operating system, while the blue bars are jobs
    running in virtual machines. The decrease of VRE jobs is partially explained
    by an increasing number of bare metal jobs submitted.}

%%% REDUNDANT
% A system for the dynamic, on-demand provisioning of virtual machines
% to run jobs in a high energy physics context on an external, not
% dedicated resource as realized at the HPC
% cluster \NEMO at University of Freiburg has been described.
% Reasons for the need for an interface between the schedulers of the host system
% and the external system from which requests are sent have been
% explained.
% The performance and usage have been analyzed for selected cases.
%
% This approach can be generalized to other platforms and possibly also
% other forms of virtualized environments (containers).
